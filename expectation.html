		  	my future life and career expectation, I will make a schedule of my class 
				and write some future plan about my life and career.
				Besides, I want to record some meaningful things and photos on this page, to help 
				other better understand me. I want to put my resume on this page, it will comprehensively
				show myself to others, I also plan to put my self portrait on this page. If possible, I like
				put some UX design project on this page, My enthusiasm and concern for marginalized groups whose 
				accessibility needs are not met by space and technology helped me see the infinite possibilities 
				in the Human-Computer Interaction field for improving digital experiences in space design. I want 
				to explore more innovative, multifaceted access products to connect them with their surroundings, 
				such as digital employment tools for some historically excluded groups

			I like to share some story and post on this page, I may want to put my 
			resume and put a Q&A part to help people easily contact with me. I also 
			want to make a part to record other's good ideas. 
			What arise my interests in UX design: Incorporating various technologies into design sometimes shifts 
			the priority from effective, accessible designs to more profit-driven outcomes. 
			This can reinforce the matrix of domination and further disenfranchise marginalized 
			populations like the elder and people with disabilities. In the interest of social welfare, 
			I think there should be clear checks and balances in design that temper the best interest 
			of the people served and profit. This keen interest in ethical, technological design piqued 
			my interest in the Human-Computer Interaction field
