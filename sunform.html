		<h1>sunrises and sunsets</h1>
		<p><br>
			the different sunrises and sunsets which I recorded, I want to share some beautiful sunset and sunrise
			in my homepage. I think it is a positive attitude to life. People could browse them and these pictures 
			could convery a good mood and life attitude to them.
			Contemplating this scenario while gazing sunward at dusk or dawn, we might feel as if we could sense the difference between the two times of day. But in real life, it's impossible to completely divorce our perceptions of the scene from our awareness of the hour. So, is there any objective way to distinguish an upward-trending sun from a downward one?
      According to atmospheric physicists David Lynch and William Livingston, the answer is "yes, and no."
		</p>
		<p><br>
			Feeling: The first is in our heads. "At sunset, our eyes are daylight adapted and may even be a bit weary from the day's toil," 
			Lynch and Livingston write. "As the light fades, we cannot adapt as fast as the sky darkens. Some hues may be lost or perceived 
			in a manner peculiar to sunset. At sunrise, however, the night's darkness has left us with very acute night vision and every faint, 
			minor change in the sky's color is evident." In short, you may perceive more colors at dawn than at dusk. [Red-Green & Blue-Yellow:

			In the future, I want to put some video and my innovations on this page, I want to show myself in all directions.
			For example, I will put some vlogs, research process, landscape modeling process and plants analysis in here.
			By doing this, It could attract people who has same hobby with me!
