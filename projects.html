				<h2>EVOLVING CONNECTION between affection and ecology</h2>
				<p>
				DaQing is a prefecture-level city in the west of Heilongjiang province, People's Republic of China.
				The city is developed due to discovery of oil. However, Nowadays, with the sharp decline in production 
				and environmental pollution, people living in Daqing have gradually developed complex ecological problem 
				and affection disorder.
				PRACTICAL FORM-CORRIDOR&VIRTUAL FORM-CONNECTION: solving ecological problem and affective disorder.
				Nowadays, with the sharp decline in production and environmental pollution, people living in Daqing have 
      	gradually developed complex and contradictory emotions towards the city they used to be proud of.
				According site's axis and pattern, the possible junction core is determined to maximumly increase connection 
				between local residents and nature.

				01 Site pattern: The design obtains the pattern of the base through route and land patches.
				02 Basic geometry: The design adjusts the pattern boundary to form the basic geometry.
				03 dilution & drainage: By generating a hexagonal ecological purification terrain, the design 
				produces a drainage effect on water.
				04 Excavation & accumulation: By digging the surface salinized soil, the design purifies soil by composting.
				05 Cohesion & axis: According to the site axis, the design rotate, stretch, and scale each ecological site to 
				produce dynamic changes and a better onflow effect.
				06 Refinement & decoration: According to the axis characteristics, the design connect the protrusions to create 
				a connection between man and nature.

				From the above figures, with the increase of vegetation coverage, the overall trend of flow velocity on slopes of 
      	10°, 20° and 25° is decreasing.This was consistent with the expectation that vegetation would hinder the movement of 
      	water flow, and the denser the vegetation, the lower the flow velocity.When the vegetation coverage is 10%~30%, the 
      	overland velocity decreases rapidly; when the vegetation coverage is 30%~80%, the overland velocity decreases slowly; 
      	therefore, 30% plants density is an inflection point. In order to ensure rain infiltration, choosing plants who both 
				have a low Leaf absorbability and a canopy rainwater retention ability. Abundant height difference in functional areas 
				not only use Landfill soil to rebuild local ecology, but also make site more interesting to release people's affective disorder.
